Input: Given text file located at "/resources/PrefixOfCodesList_ForFilter.txt" contains prefix of code for which we need to map more-less specific.

Database: ICD9_LOOKUP_ezNLP
Table: codeMaster
Query: SELECT Code, Description FROM ICD9_LOOKUP_ezNLP.codeMaster where billableFlag= 1 AND Code like '" + prefix_code + "%'
Store fetched data in "/Generated Files/Code Desc" contains same number of files as number of prefix codes


RunApplyAllFilters:
	1. Load previously mapped more-less pair from "/resources/PreviosKnowledge.tsv"
	2. Load all code prefixes in arraylist from "/resources/PrefixOfCodesList_ForFilter.txt"  
	3. for each code prefix in /resources/PrefixOfCodesList_ForFilter.txt 
		3.1. Fetch Code-Description pair from database, write code-description pair to file ('\t' separated) and give the filename as prefix_code.tsv
		3.2. Remove special symbols from description
		3.3. remove ignore words from description
		3.4. map code more-less codes without filter
		3.5. Apply first filter (Principal Symptom)
			- in Aragya resources this file has codes ranges (not direct code pairs)
			- ecplise project MakePairsOfCodes makes direct code-code pair
			- this method uses pair generated by MakePairsOfCodes (copy-paste file manually from MakePairsOfCodes to resource of this project)
		  	- compare file from mapping without filter (contains code-desc-code-desc) if code pair is in PrincipalSymtom do not include it
		  	- compare file from mapping without filter (contains code-desc-code-desc) if it is already been coded skip this pair
		  	- output will be written at "/Generated Files/Filter - 1 PrincipalSymptom"
		  	
		3.6. Apply second filter (More Specific Code Range) 
			- in Aragya resources this file has codes ranges (not direct code pairs)
			- ecplise project MakePairsOfCodes makes direct code-code pair
			- this method uses pair generated by MakePairsOfCodes (copy-paste file manually from MakePairsOfCodes to resource of this project)
		  	- compare file from file after 1st filter (contains code-desc-code-desc) if code pair is in MoreSPecific do not include it
		  	- compare file from file after 1st filter (contains code-desc-code-desc) if it is already been coded skip this pair
		  	- output will be written at "/Generated Files/Filter - 2 More Specific"
		  	
		3.7. Apply third filter (Less Specific Codes) 
			- in Aragya resources this file has direct code mapping but not it desired format
			- ecplise project MakePairsOfCodes makes direct code-code pair
			- this method uses pair generated by MakePairsOfCodes (copy-paste file manually from MakePairsOfCodes to resource of this project)
		  	- compare file from file after 2nd filter (contains code-desc-code-desc) if code pair is in MoreSPecific do not include it
		  	- compare file from file after 2nd filter (contains code-desc-code-desc) if it is already been coded skip this pair
		  	- output will be written at "/Generated Files/Filter - 1 PrincipalSymptom"		  	
		
		3.8. Apply fourth CheckForUnspecified 
			- for this filter there is separate java class
			- logic of this filter is taken from arogya/icd910lookup module 
			- this filter uses output of third filter 
			- this filter does not add previously coded pair
			-  output will be written at "/Generated Files/Filter - 4 Unspecified"
			
RunDeletePreviosOutput: 
	- This module simply deletes all files generated previously 
	- We can also delete files manually
	- Module only deletes file does not delete folder
			
*It is recommended that all classes of MakePairsOfCodes should be executed before executing this. And copy all generated files (except "code_list_db.txt") and paste it resources of this project.
